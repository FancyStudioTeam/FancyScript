# Reference

## Optional Fields

Some functions have fields/arguments that are optional. These fields are marked with a `?` at the end of the name.

| Name              | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| required_field    | A required field.                    |
| optional_field`?` | An optional field. (Marked with `?`) |

### Difference between required and optional fields

- `Required`: These fields must be present in the functions. Otherwise, the function will return a requirement error.
- `Optional`: These fields do not need to be present.

## Overloaded Functions

Overloaded functions are functions that have the ability to accept different types of arguments.

Overloaded functions are indicated by the `âš¡` emoji at the end of the function name.
