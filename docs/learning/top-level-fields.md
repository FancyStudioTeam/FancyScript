# Top Level Fields

The top level fields are fields where YAMLCord will get the input data.

## List of Top Level Fields

| Field       | Type    | Description            |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| `sequences` | `array` | An array of sequences. |

### Top Level Field: `sequences`

Because YAMLCord is executed by sequences, YAML files must have a top-level field called `sequences`. This field is an array where the sequences to be executed are indicated.

```yml
sequences: # Array of sequences
```

:::info Sequences Example

```yml
sequences:
  - create_message(): "Hello, world!"
  - add_reaction(): "ðŸ‘‹"
```
